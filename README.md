# Javascript
My first JavaScript programs
JavaScript is a dynamic programming language which runs on the web browser. Every browser is contained with javaScript Engine for the js programs to run.
VSCode Editor - the tool I've been used for writing programs.It provides environment to run the html and js embedded code and the terminal provided with live-server to run on the web page.
